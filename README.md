#DB nc_school project is a school database that will register new students with their personal information,  create new user accounts, create new classes, assign teacher to classes.
It will be composed by 4 main tables: Students, User_account, Classes and Teachers 
I am hoping to get the following columns for each table:
    Tables: Students (id, first_name, last_name, phone#, address)
    User_account (user_id, password, email)
    Grades (class_id, student_id, grade)
    Classes(id, teacher_id, class_name, semester_cycle)
    Teachers(id, class_id, first_name, last_name)
